  <p>
    Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.<br/>
    Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work.<br/>
    Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. it must make the first character in the string upper case).<br/>
    The string will always start with a letter and will never be empty.<br/>
    
    Examples:<br/>
    "hello" --> "Hello"<br/>
    "Hello" --> "Hello" (the first letter was already capitalized)<br/>
    "a"     --> "A"<br/>
  </p>
  <script>
    const newP = document.createElement("sapn");

    let word = 'hello --->';
    function capitalizeWord(word) {
    let newWord = word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1, word.length);
    return newWord;
}

    newP.textContent  = capitalizeWord(word);
    document.body.append(word);
    document.body.append(newP);

  </script>
